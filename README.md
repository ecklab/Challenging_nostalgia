### Challenging nostalgia repo

This repo contains materials that accompany my baseball paper that showed that nostalgia, performance metrics, and sophisticated era-adjustment approaches have fallen short of their goal to properly compare players across eras. Here is a description of the materials:

 - Final draft of the paper: Chance-baseball-final.pdf
 
 - Reproducible technical report: reproducible-analysis.pdf
 
 - dataset: population.csv
 
 - raw data: see the contents of the data directory.

A Shiny app that allows others to produce their own analyses within the framework of 
this analysis can be viewed [here](https://deck13.shinyapps.io/challenging_baseball_nostalgia/). A fun Fangraphs article with additional musings can be viewed [here](https://community.fangraphs.com/challenging-war-and-other-statistics-as-era-adjustment-tools/).
